# ChatFilter
<p>LUA SAMP Chat Filter for UIF.</p>
<p>This is a lua script that can block certain messages from showing in UIF SAMP Server.</p>
<p>Messages are still stored in the chatlog.</p>

### [Pre-requisites]
1. ASI Loader
2. Moonloader
3. SAMPFuncs

### [Installation]
Extract the release zip into your Moonloader folder. 

### [Usage]
<p>Open the filters.txt file from the folder ChatFilter to add words that will be blocked in-game.</p>
<p>Make sure there are no spaces at the beginning of each sentence.</p>
<p>If blocking does not seem to work, copy the word that you're having trouble with (with color code, if necessary) from the chatlog and put it in the filters.txt file.</p>
<p>Use <b>/chatfilter</b> in-game to toggle the filter on and off.</p>
