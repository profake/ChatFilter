# ChatFilter
LUA SAMP Chat Filter for UIF.
<p>This is a lua script that can block certain messages from showing in UIF SAMP Server.</p>

### [Pre-requisites]
1. ASI Loader
2. Moonloader
3. SAMPFuncs

### [Installation]
Put everything from this repository to your Moonloader folder. 

### [Usage]
Open the filters.txt file from the folder ChatFilter to add words that will be blocked in-game.
Make sure there are no spaces at the beginning of each sentence.
If blocking does not seem to work, copy the word that you're having trouble with (with color code, if necessary) from the chatlog and put it in the filters.txt file.
Use /chatfilter in-game to toggle the filter on and off.
